[{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "I want to build a mobile app called Couply, designed for couples to grow closer privately while also connecting socially with other couples. The app should work on Android and iOS, with a clean, modern UI (Instagram/TikTok style) and a playful, romantic vibe. Privacy, security, and scalability are top priorities.\r\n\r\nCore Features:\r\n\r\nCouple Profiles & Onboarding: users sign up individually, then link accounts with their partner to form a shared couple profile (with photo, anniversary date, and bio). Couples can choose between private-only mode or private + social mode.\r\n\r\nPrivate Couple Space: secure chat (text, images, voice notes, stickers, hugs/kisses), shared calendar for anniversaries and date nights, mood tracker with insights, shared goals/to-do lists, and a memory vault for photos, videos, and journals.\r\n\r\nSocial Community: feed where couples post updates, love notes, photos, and stories. Interactions include likes, comments, and shares. There are challenges (e.g., best throwback date photo), discussion groups (newlyweds, long-distance, parenting), milestone celebrations, and a date ideas hub for sharing and discovery.\r\n\r\nEngagement & Gamification: fun quizzes, badges (100 days together, 1-year anniversaries), leaderboards for challenges, and daily prompts like \u201cSend your partner a compliment today.\u201d\r\n\r\nMonetization: freemium model with premium subscriptions ($4.99\u2013$9.99/month) offering unlimited storage, advanced insights, exclusive groups, ad-free experience, and premium stickers/themes. Additional revenue streams include an in-app shop for gifts, vouchers, and experiences, plus partnerships with restaurants and travel companies.\r\n\r\nTechnical Requirements: cloud backend (Firebase/AWS), secure login (email, phone, social), end-to-end encrypted chats, push notifications, payment integration (Stripe + M-PESA for Kenya), and AI-assisted moderation for community content.\r\n\r\nDesign & Branding: app name is Couply, tagline \u201cWhere Couples Grow Together.\u201d Branding should be clean, modern, and playful with a romantic gradient (rose pink \u2192 deep purple) or navy + pastel. Logo/icon should be heart-inspired with a couple vibe.\r\n\r\nTarget Audience: couples aged 18\u201335 (dating, engaged, newlyweds, long-distance), starting in Kenya but scalable globally. Build in modular form so we can launch an MVP first, then expand with social, gamification, and monetization features."}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I understand. You want to build a mobile app called Couply for couples to connect privately and socially. Here's a plan for the initial design and development:\n\n**Features for the First Version (MVP):**\n\n-   **Couple Profiles & Onboarding:** Implement the basic signup and profile creation for individual users, and the ability to link accounts to form a couple profile. Include options for profile photo, anniversary date, and a short bio. Start with the \"private-only\" mode.\n-   **Private Couple Space:** Focus on the secure chat feature (text and images) and a shared calendar for important dates.\n-   **Basic Navigation:** Implement a simple and intuitive tab-based navigation to switch between profile, chat, and calendar.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n-   **Colors:**\n    -   Background: `#F8F8FF` (Light, almost white background)\n    -   Text: `#282828` (Dark gray for primary text)\n    -   TextSecondary: `#708090` (Slate gray for less important text)\n    -   Primary: `#E91E63` (Rose Pink, as per your branding)\n    -   Secondary: `#673AB7` (Deep Purple, as per your branding)\n    -   Accent: `#FF4081` (A brighter pink for highlights)\n    -   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White for cards and modals)\n    -   Highlight: `#FFCDD2` (A very light pink for subtle highlights)\n-   **Typography:** Use a modern and clean font like \"System\" for a native look and feel.\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n\n1.  **Color Palette:** Define the color palette in a central location (e.g., `constants/Colors.ts`) for easy access and modification.\n2.  **Theme:** Implement a light theme using the defined color palette.\n3.  **UI Components:** Create basic UI components for profile display, chat input, and calendar view.\n4.  **Navigation:** Set up tab-based navigation using Expo Router.\n5.  **Profile Screen:** Implement the profile creation and linking functionality.\n6.  **Chat Screen:** Implement a basic chat interface with text and image support.\n7.  **Calendar Screen:** Implement a shared calendar view.\n8.  **Remove modalDemos:** Remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement the plan and modify the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-02T21:53:06.712895"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build the Couply app!
